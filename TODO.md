# DeployBot Project Tasks

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES - Discovered January 2, 2025

### **HIGH PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED**
- [ ] **FIX: Custom notification windows not displaying** #critical #backend #websocket
  - Backend processes commands but doesn't send proper WebSocket messages to create windows
  - Expected format: `{type: 'notification', event: 'show_custom', data: {notification: {...}}}`
  - Status: No visual notifications appear despite backend success responses

- [ ] **FIX: Task selection system completely broken** #critical #backend #tasks
  - Returns "No tasks found" for all projects despite populated TODO.md files  
  - Tested: My_Awesome_Project (6 tasks), DemoProject (10 tasks) - all fail
  - Status: Zero task suggestions generated

- [ ] **FIX: Snooze functionality not working** #critical #notifications
  - Commands process successfully but notifications don't reappear after delay
  - May require DeployBot restart to load previous fixes
  - Status: Snooze feature completely non-functional

- [ ] **URGENT: End-to-end notification testing** #critical #integration
