## ADR-001: Tailwind Version Selection

### 🎯 Decision
Use **Tailwind CSS v3.4** instead of Tailwind v4 for the UI framework.

### 📝 Context
The original Week 4 scaffold documentation mentioned Tailwind v4 as the planned CSS framework. However, during implementation setup, compatibility and stability concerns arose.

### 🤔 Rationale
- **Stability**: Tailwind v4 has buggy features that could impact development velocity
- **Compatibility**: v3.4 has better ecosystem compatibility with our Electron + React + Vite stack
- **Documentation**: More comprehensive documentation and community resources for v3.4
- **Production Ready**: v3.4 is proven in production environments

### ✅ Implementation
- Updated `package.json` to use Tailwind v3.4
- Configured `tailwind.config.js` with v3.4 syntax
- Updated `postcss.config.js` for v3.4 compatibility
- Created comprehensive CSS with v3.4 utility classes

### 📊 Consequences
- **Positive**: Stable build system, reliable utility classes, extensive documentation
- **Negative**: Missing some newer features from v4, eventual migration needed
- **Mitigation**: Migration path exists when v4 stabilizes

## ADR-002: IPC Communication Method

### 🎯 Decision
Implement **WebSocket-based IPC** from Day 1 instead of starting with `child_process.exec` and upgrading later.

### 📝 Context
Original scaffolding documentation suggested starting with simple `child_process.exec` for Electron ↔ Python communication, with WebSocket as a future upgrade. During implementation, we chose to implement WebSocket immediately.

### 🤔 Rationale
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket enables bidirectional, real-time communication needed for deploy detection and status updates
- **Better Architecture**: Cleaner separation between Electron and Python processes
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple concurrent operations and streaming data
- **Development Efficiency**: Avoid rework and migration complexity later
- **Feature Requirements**: Deploy monitoring requires continuous communication, not just request-response

### ✅ Implementation
- Created `bridge/websocket_bridge.js` for Electron-side WebSocket client
- Implemented WebSocket server in `langgraph/graph.py` with structured message handling
- Added reconnection logic and message queuing for reliability
- Exposed WebSocket methods through `preload.js` context bridge
- Built React components with real-time WebSocket integration

### 📊 Consequences
- **Positive**: Real-time UI updates, better error handling, cleaner architecture, no migration needed
- **Negative**: Higher initial complexity, additional dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging and error handling implemented

## ADR-003: File Structure Approach

### 🎯 Decision
Use **main/ folder structure (Option A)** instead of standard Electron file organization.

### 📝 Context
During project setup, we chose a specific file structure that prioritizes separation of concerns over Electron conventions.

### 🤔 Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between Electron app logic and React UI
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage as the project grows in complexity
- **Development Experience**: More intuitive for developers working on specific layers
- **Modularity**: Better organization for the bridge layer and Python backend

### ✅ Implementation
```
DeployBot/
├── main/                    ← Electron app layer
│   ├── main.js             ← Main process
│   ├── preload.js          ← Security bridge
│   └── renderer/           ← React UI
├── bridge/                 ← IPC communication layer
├── langgraph/             ← Python backend
└── projects/              ← User data
```

### 📊 Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation, easier maintenance, intuitive organization
- **Negative**: Deviates from Electron conventions, potential confusion for new contributors
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and clear naming conventions

## ADR-004: Implementation Acceleration

### 🎯 Decision
Implement **full production-ready infrastructure** in Week 1 instead of gradual scaffolding approach.

### 📝 Context
Original Week 1 scaffold suggested basic stubs and placeholder functionality. We chose to implement comprehensive, production-ready components immediately.

### 🤔 Rationale
- **Avoid Rework**: Building complete components prevents refactoring later
- **Integration Testing**: Full stack enables end-to-end testing from Day 1
- **Development Velocity**: No time lost on throwaway code
- **Quality Assurance**: Production patterns established early
- **User Experience**: Functional demo available immediately

### ✅ Implementation
**Week 1 Deliverables Expanded:**
- ✅ Complete WebSocket communication infrastructure
- ✅ Production-ready React components with state management
- ✅ Comprehensive CSS framework with responsive design
- ✅ Full Python backend with structured logging and error handling
- ✅ Project management system with real data persistence
- ✅ Global shortcuts and native OS integration
- ✅ Mock data system for development and testing

**vs. Original Week 1 Plan:**
- ❌ Simple child_process communication
- ❌ Basic HTML placeholder UI
- ❌ Python print statements
- ❌ Manual IPC testing

### 📊 Consequences
- **Positive**: Fully functional app from Week 1, no technical debt, comprehensive testing capability
- **Negative**: Higher upfront development time, more complex initial setup
- **Mitigation**: Extensive logging and documentation for debugging

## 🔄 Future Decision Points

### Pending Decisions
1. **LLM Provider Selection**: OpenAI vs local models for task selection
2. **Deploy Detection Enhancement**: File watching vs shell integration
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: macOS-only vs Windows/Linux expansion
4. **Data Persistence**: File-based vs database storage

### Monitoring Points
1. **WebSocket Performance**: Monitor for latency issues with continuous communication
2. **Tailwind v4 Migration**: Track v4 stability for future upgrade
3. **Electron Updates**: Security and performance improvements
4. **Python Dependencies**: LangGraph and WebSocket library updates
