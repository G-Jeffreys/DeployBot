# üîç DeployBot Investigation Report - January 2, 2025

## üìã **Executive Summary**

During user testing of the notification system, critical failures were discovered that render DeployBot's core functionality non-operational. Despite backend logic appearing to work correctly, no visual notifications appear and task selection completely fails.

**Impact**: HIGH SEVERITY - Core value proposition of DeployBot is currently broken.

## üéØ **Investigation Scope**

**Initial Issue**: User reported "I didn't see anything" when testing the snooze functionality.

**Investigation Period**: January 2, 2025, 7:15 PM - 7:20 PM PST

**Methodology**: 
- WebSocket command testing via Python scripts
- Backend response analysis  
- Project structure verification
- Code path analysis
- System status verification

```
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Connection established, received system status

#### ‚úÖ **Test 2: Snooze Functionality** 
```bash
Command: test-snooze-quick
Response: {"success": true, "message": "Test snooze triggered - should reappear in 10 seconds"}
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Backend Success / ‚ùå No Visual Notification

#### ‚ùå **Test 3: Task Selection System**
```bash
Command: test-week3-workflow (My_Awesome_Project)

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Notification Windows Not Appearing**

#### **Evidence**
- Backend processes `test-snooze-quick` successfully
- Returns `{"success": true}` response  
- 15-second monitoring shows no notification windows
- User reports no visual feedback

#### **Code Analysis**
**Electron Frontend** (`main/main.js`):
- ‚úÖ Complete custom notification window system implemented
- ‚úÖ `createNotificationWindow()` function exists
- ‚úÖ WebSocket message handler exists: 
  ```javascript
  if (message.type === 'notification' && message.event === 'show_custom')
  ```

**Python Backend** (`backend/notification.py`):
- ‚úÖ `_send_notification()` method exists
- ‚úÖ Processes notification requests
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Proper WebSocket broadcast to trigger window creation

#### **Root Cause**
Backend notification system doesn't send the correct WebSocket message format to trigger Electron notification window creation.

**Expected Message Format**:
```json
{
  "type": "notification",
  "event": "show_custom",
  "data": {
    "notification": {
      "id": "notification_123",
      "title": "Task Suggestion",
      "message": "...",
      "data": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### **Issue 2: Task Selection System Failure**

#### **Evidence**
- Multiple projects with populated TODO.md files
- Proper task formatting with hashtag tagging
- Consistent "No tasks found" responses across all projects
- Both heuristic and LLM-based selection failing

#### **Potential Causes**
1. File path resolution issues
2. TODO.md parsing logic broken
3. Task filtering logic too restrictive
4. Project path context incorrect

### **Issue 3: Snooze System Breakdown**

#### **Evidence**  
- Backend processes snooze commands
- Previous conversation mentions snooze fixes implemented
- No notifications reappear after delay periods
- May require DeployBot restart to load fixes

#### **Status**
Partially addressed in previous session but requires verification after notification display fix.

## üö® **Impact Assessment**

### **Severity: CRITICAL**
- **Core Functionality**: Notification system is primary DeployBot feature
- **User Experience**: Zero visual feedback during deploy wait periods
- **Value Proposition**: Productivity assistance completely unavailable

### **Affected Components**
1. **Deploy Detection ‚Üí Notification Pipeline**: Broken
2. **Task Suggestion System**: Non-functional  
3. **Snooze/Reminder Functionality**: Broken
4. **User Workflow**: Deploy detection works but no subsequent actions

### **Working Components**
1. ‚úÖ WebSocket communication infrastructure
2. ‚úÖ App redirection system (Bear, Figma, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Timer functionality
4. ‚úÖ Backend command processing
5. ‚úÖ Process monitoring

---

## üîß **Recommended Immediate Actions**

### **Priority 1: Fix Notification Broadcasting**
**Location**: `backend/notification.py` - `_send_notification()` method
**Action**: Add WebSocket broadcast call to trigger Electron window creation
**Expected Fix**:
```python
await self.websocket_server.broadcast({
    "type": "notification",
    "event": "show_custom", 
    "data": {"notification": notification}
})
```

### **Priority 2: Debug Task Selection**
**Location**: `backend/tasks.py` or task selection logic
**Action**: Add comprehensive logging to task parsing pipeline
**Investigation**: Why TODO.md files aren't being found/parsed

### **Priority 3: Verify Snooze System**  
**Prerequisite**: Fix notification display first
**Action**: Test complete snooze cycle after notifications appear
**Timeline**: After Priority 1 completion

### **Priority 4: Integration Testing**
**Scope**: End-to-end workflow testing
**Flow**: Deploy detection ‚Üí Task selection ‚Üí Notification display ‚Üí User interaction ‚Üí Snooze ‚Üí Reappear

---

## üìà **Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Notification Display Fix**
1. Implement WebSocket broadcast fix
2. Test `test-snooze-quick` command
3. Verify notification window appears
4. Test manual dismiss functionality

### **Phase 2: Task Selection Debug**
1. Add debug logging to task selection
2. Test with known-good TODO.md files
3. Verify task parsing logic
4. Test task filtering and selection

### **Phase 3: End-to-End Verification**
1. Test complete deployment workflow
2. Verify notification persistence
3. Test snooze/reappear cycle
4. Validate app redirection from notifications

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Notification System**
- [ ] Visual notification windows appear for test commands
- [ ] Notifications display correct content and actions
- [ ] User can interact with notification buttons
- [ ] Notifications close properly on dismiss

### **Task Selection**
- [ ] Projects with TODO.md files return valid tasks
- [ ] Task selection respects tag filtering
- [ ] Selected tasks include proper context (app, duration, tags)

### **Snooze Functionality**
- [ ] Snooze button dismisses current notification
- [ ] Notification reappears after specified delay
- [ ] Snoozed notifications show "(Reminder)" text
- [ ] Multiple snooze cycles work correctly

### **Integration**
- [ ] Deploy detection triggers task selection
- [ ] Task selection triggers notification display
- [ ] Notification actions work end-to-end
- [ ] System operates reliably over time

## üìù **Investigation Conclusion**

**Key Insight**: The investigation revealed a classic **backend-frontend disconnect**. While the Python backend processes all commands correctly and the Electron frontend has a complete notification system, they're not communicating properly due to incorrect WebSocket message formatting.

**Next Steps**: Focus on the WebSocket message broadcasting fix as the highest priority, as this will unlock testing of all other notification-related functionality.

**Timeline**: Notification fix should be implementable within 1-2 hours, followed by systematic testing of task selection and snooze functionality.

**Investigation Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Root causes identified, action plan established
**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå **PENDING** - Fixes not yet implemented
**Next Action**: Begin Priority 1 implementation (notification broadcasting fix)
