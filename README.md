# 🤖 DeployBot

**Production-ready desktop productivity assistant** that detects backend deployment events and intelligently redirects developers to productive alternative tasks during deployment wait periods. Built with enterprise-grade architecture featuring LangGraph AI agents, WebSocket communication, and sophisticated task selection.

**Key Innovation**: While local deployment commands complete quickly (30 seconds), cloud propagation takes 10-30 minutes. DeployBot fills this productivity gap with AI-powered task suggestions tailored to the waiting period.

## 🎯 What DeployBot Does

1. **Detects Deployments**: Monitors when you run deployment commands (`firebase deploy`, `vercel --prod`, etc.)
2. **Starts Timer**: Begins tracking your deployment wait time (default 30 minutes)
3. **Suggests Tasks**: After a grace period, intelligently suggests alternative tasks from your TODO.md
4. **Redirects Focus**: Opens the appropriate app (Bear, Figma, VSCode) for the suggested task
5. **Logs Activity**: Tracks all deployments, task selections, and productivity sessions
